# Installing and Running PointCP

PointCP demonstrates now a class can be designed that will support both
cartesian and polar co-ordinates. It is the basis of several examples in
the book <a href="http://www.site.uottawa.ca/school/research/lloseng/"> "Object-Oriented Software
Engineering:  Practical Software Development using UML and Java"</a> by
Lethbridge and Lagani&egrave;re.</p>

To compile the files execute the following command

```
javac PointCP.java PointCPTest.java
```

To run the program

```
java PointCPTest
```
