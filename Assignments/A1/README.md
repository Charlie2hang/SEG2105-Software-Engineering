This repository contains a copy of [the code required to complete the first assignment](https://github.com/TimLethbridge/Lloseng)
using the book [Object-Oriented Software Engineering: Practical Software
Development using UML and Java](http://www.site.uottawa.ca/school/research/lloseng/), 2nd Edition, 2004 McGraw Hill.

# Assignment 1 - 5% of the final grade (started during lab 2) 

Assignment Submission before October 4th, 11h59pm using [BrightSpace](https://uottawa.brightspace.com/)

The TA will explain how to setup your environment during lab 2, how to measure the execution time of a Java program and HOW TO DEBUG!

**INSTRUCTIONS**

* Use the following invitation to join or create a repository for assignment 1. As we will do for the project, one member of the team creates the repository, the other joins it. 

```
https://classroom.github.com/a/205kNZfs
```
* You also need to create a Group in Brightspace (Groups_Assignment1).

**Group work and partners**: In this lab, and all other labs that involve programming, you
will work in **groups of two**. You can work with students in ANY lab section (SEG2105B or SEG2105C). 
You can also work individually. **No groups of 3 will be permitted.**

## Format

Your **private** repository should be named \[prefix\]-\[student-number-1\]_\[student-number-2\], for example

```
assignment1-1484511_90210901210
```

When finished, submit the following text via the Brightspace submission link: 

* Your names and students numbers
* A link to your GitHub repository.

Your GitHub repository should contain all solutions to the Assignment 1.
Only the information above should be submitted to BrightSpace.
Submissions by email will NOT be accepted.

## Logistics

#### Using Eclipse

Eclipse will be presented in this lab. However, feel free to use your preferred IDE.
Instruction on how to setup your environment will be presented during the beginning of lab 2. 

#### Exercises

Work on the following exercises from the textbook. You must hand in
only one copy of answers per group. Make sure the names and student numbers
of both partners are clearly indicated. You must work on these questions
during the lab and then finish off the work on your own time before the deadline.

## Analysis of various design alternatives

1. Before coming to the lab, you are asked to read and understand Section 2.9 of
the textbook, starting on page 57. If you have not done this, take five
minutes now to do it. The texbook pages necessary to complete this assignment can be found in the Brightspace.

2. This Lab/Assignment will focus on [PointCP](/pointcp) from this repository,
so all instructions will be relative to that directory.

```
cd pointcp
```

Before making any changes, compile the code and make sure it runs.

```
javac PointCP.java PointCPTest.java
```

To run the program

```
java PointCPTest
```
You can, of course, run the programs using the Eclipse IDE (or your preferred IDE).

## PointCP

All modifications should be done within the `/pointcp` directory.
By modifying the original version (Design 1), implement the following designs.

* design 2 (add code in `/design2` directory). Add your code in  `PointCP2.java`. 
* design 3 (add code in `/design3` directory). Add your code in  `PointCP3.java` . 
* design 5 (add code in `/design6` directory). Add your code in  `PointCP5.java` and modify your existing  `PointCP2.java` and  `PointCP3.java` (to adapt them to the new design requirements. 

4. Modify the `PointCPTest` class to allow you to test the designs you
have developed. Do a thorough series of tests to ensure your classes work properly. You can implement other classes to facilitate the task or add any extar functions to the `PointCPTest` class. 

5. Hand in your answers to exercises E26 (table of what you think will be the advantages and
disadvantages of each design), and E28-E30 (performance analysis, comparing all three
designs you have implemented instead of Design 1 with Design 5 as the book says). To do
this evaluation, for each design create random instances and then call each method many
thousands of times, and then find the elapsed time in milliseconds for the fixed number
of iterations. Make sure that your program runs each time for about 10 seconds so you
get a good measure of performance. Test each method separately. Run each version
several times to ensure that your results are consistent and use the median result as your
definitive result, plus give the maximum and minimum execution time.

6. Hand in a description of how you did the tests, sample outputs from running the tests,
the table and a discussion of the results.


| Design | How cartesian coordinates are computed | How polar coordinates are computed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design 2: Store polar coordinates only | Computed on demand, but not stored| Simply returned |
| Design 3: Store cartesian coordinates only | Simply returned | Computed on demand, but not stored |
| Design 5: Abstract class with designs 2 and 3 as subclasses| Depends on the concrete class used | Depends on the concrete class used |

All your written answers can be submitted in a single Word or PDF document. Make sure to push this document into your repository.

## PART 2 - Arrays

Compare the performance of ArrayList, Vector and ordinary arrays. You should do a
series of experiments where you do each of the following tests with the three types of
collection, timing the execution of each run. You should run each case several times on
the same computer to obtain stable average timings.

(a) Construct very large collections by putting random integers into each collection
one at a time. The random integers should range in value from zero to nine. You
should make each collection large enough so that the run takes at least 10 seconds to
add the integers in the case of an ArrayList. You will have to do some initial
experiments to find out what is a good size. You would use the same size of collection
for ArrayList, Vector and the array. The ArrayList and Vector can be created by
successively adding items and allowing them to grow, while the array has to be
created at its full size and then populated with its contents. You could also try to
experiment with the case where you do create the ArrayList and Vector initially with
their full size.

(b) Construct very large collections as in (a). Then use iterators to sum the elements.
Subtract the construction time to get a measure of how much time the iteration takes.
Use a for loop for the array, and an Iterator for the Vector and ArrayList.
Present your data in suitable tables and draw conclusions from an analysis of the data. From
your conclusions, develop recommendations to designers.
